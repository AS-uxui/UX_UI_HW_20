                <h5>The Problem</h5><p>There is no easy-to-use tool that supports travellers for a unique immersive experience.</p>
                <h5>The Solution</h5><p>This solution offers the modern traveller the ability to plan their trips using a mobile app. It gives them the flexibility to change plans at their destination to suit needs and budget</p>
                                
                <p>My team conducted a research to understand the pain points of travellers.  Qualitative data gleaned from interviews was paired with quantitative data generated from an e-survey. </p>
                <h5>Pain points:</h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Using too many tools to plan trips</li>
                    <li>Difficulty coordinating trips with others</li>
                    <li>Applications are difficult to navigate and run slowly</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h5>User Insight</h5><p>A traveller on vacation with their young family needs a tool to plan family friendly activities because they want to deepen familial bonds as they explore and enjoy the experience.</p>

            <p>I iterated the wireframes and create a link to the set up alerts screen and a link to the coaching screen for alerts in the planning a trip screen. 

                The user flow would logically take the user to the alerts screen when the have confirmed or paying for their trip. The participants in the usability tests would benefit from the alert accessible through a link or a sitemap.

                <p>I addressed the navigational difficulty of Task 5 in the guerilla usuability tests by iterating 2 wireframes (Confirm trip and Destination search). 
                    I added a way for the member to set up an alert when they choose to confirm a trip or search for a destination. I would also add a tooltip to the alert or a way to access the coaching screen from the tool tip in the final product.
